Source codes of [Efficient Object-Level Visual Context Modeling for Multimodal Machine Translation: Masking Irrelevant Objects Helps Grounding](https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AAAI-1370.WangD.pdf).

This code repository was built based on the research [A Visual Attention Grounding Neural Model for Multimodal Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08266) and its open-source pytorch implementations ([zmykevin](https://github.com/zmykevin/A-Visual-Attention-Grounding-Neural-Model) and [Eurus-Holmes](https://github.com/Eurus-Holmes/VAG-NMT)). Thanks for these efforts.

## 1. Data 

- Preprocessed Data of Multi30K and AmbiguousCOCO

  Download from [[baidu]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Ruvrt7n8VDzqE-fjwW0m8A) (Password: ovc0).

  **< NOTE >**

  - The object-level visual features are too large (â‰ˆ12GB).
  - It is suggested to download the original Multi30K/AmbiguousCOCO dataset and then extract the visual object features from pre-trained Faster RCNN using the [bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) project by yourself or using our implement [bta_vision_extract.ipynb](https://github.com/wonderseen/OVC-MMT/blob/main/scripts/bta_vision_extract.ipynb) that further filters objects predicted with low object category probabilities.

- Data for Similarity Searching in [scripts/raw_data](https://github.com/wonderseen/OVC-MMT/tree/main/scripts/raw_data)

## 2. Train and Evaluation 

Run the scripts as follows:

```shell
# for training
. run_ovc_training.sh

# for evaluation after training
. run_ovc_evaluation.sh
```

## 3. Model Checkpoints
